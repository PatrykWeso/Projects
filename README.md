# Projects
**Year 1**
**Project Title: Save the Earth, Make it Greener**

**Description:**

Developed during my first year, this project is a website designed using HTML and CSS.
Its primary purpose is to raise awareness about environmental issues and encourage sustainable practices to make our planet greener.
Key Features:

Informational content about various environmental issues.
Practical tips and guidelines for a sustainable lifestyle.
Integration of multimedia elements (images, videos) to engage and educate visitors.
Implementation of a responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.


**Year 2 
Project Summary: Staff Record Management Application**

**Description:
The project involved the development of a JavaFX desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for an engineering company to efficiently manage staff records and salaries. The application used a database for data storage, ensuring organizational efficiency and timely salary processing. Three types of staff members were supported: administration, engineering, and student interns.**

**Key Achievements and Components:**

**Class Hierarchy:** I created a well-structured class hierarchy to represent different staff member types:

Administration Staff: 5% salary increase
Engineering Staff: 7.5% salary increase
Student Intern Staff: 2% salary increase
Database Integration: Set up a database system (e.g., MySQL or SQLite) to store employee records efficiently. Created appropriate database tables for each staff type and seamlessly integrated database operations within the application.

User-Friendly GUI: Developed an intuitive JavaFX-based GUI that allowed users to:

Add new staff members, selecting the staff type and entering relevant details.
Remove existing staff members from the database.
Edit staff member details (except salary).
Provide salary raises based on staff type.
Search for specific staff members and display their information.
Display staff members earning more than â‚¬50,000 per year.
Display staff members sorted by Name or Employee Start Date.
Quit the application.

GUI Design Considerations

MVC Pattern: Followed the Model-View-Controller

JUnit Testing: Wrote JUnit test cases

Documentation: Documented the project using JavaDoc, generating comprehensive JavaDoc documentation.

**Project 2 Year 2**
**Band Member Profiles:**

**Users can access detailed profiles of all five band members, fostering a personal connection with the band.**

**Merchandise Catalog:**
Users have the convenience of browsing the entire range of band merchandise, with access to product descriptions, images, and prices.

**Order Management:**
Users can order band merchandise effortlessly. Upon selecting a product, it is added to an order, with the system tracking the quantity and calculating the total order cost. Customers receive a comprehensive order summary for review before proceeding.

**Order Review and Submission:**
Customers can review their orders, ensuring accuracy in product selection and pricing. The system presents a complete order summary, allowing customers to cancel or confirm their orders.

**Administrator Privileges:**
Administrators have special access to create and manage merchandise listings, view all customer orders, and access administrative functions.

**Authentication and Authorization:**
A secure login system is implemented, enabling administrators to authenticate themselves and obtain the necessary permissions.

**Session Management:**
The website maintains session information, ensuring smooth user experiences while navigating the platform.

**Cookie Usage:**
Cookies are employed to retain user order information before submission, enhancing user convenience and reliability.

**Database Persistence:**
Information on products, customer orders, and user profiles is persistently stored in a database, ensuring data integrity and long-term usability.
By successfully completing this project, I have developed a robust and user-friendly e-commerce platform tailored for a band's merchandise sales. My implementation demonstrates proficiency in web development, database management, user authentication, and session handling. This platform serves both band enthusiasts and administrators efficiently, facilitating merchandise sales and order management
