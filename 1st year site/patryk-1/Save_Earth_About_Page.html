            <h2>About Earth</h2>
           <p>
             The earth is one of the greatest things, well, on earth. Saving it is like saving you're own life, but it's not just about humanity.

Look at us now. Only keeping animals alive for food, only keeping trees for our own air. That's called selfish. so spread a little generosity and save the earth. If you still don't agree with me, think of it like this.

The earth created people, sheltering them with food, water, and air.The earth helps us live, and what do we do to it? we kill it. I don't even get why we do it. A little wound has to be treated immediately with a bandage and sometimes medicine, even a tiny paper cut. A fall could lead to a hospital, while animals could be treated like the dogs in animal control or the bunnies for testing medicine on. Nobody cares about the animals. Still don't believe me? Fossil fuels and pollution can lead to melting ice. Not that winters are shorter and we won't get to play with snow longer, it's also a problem to the arctic. Polar bears have to swim for an average of NINE DAYS until they reach land, sometimes never. No rest, no nothing. a healthy polar bear eats one seal a week, and only eats the fat of it. Compared to us, three meal a day, some people could starve in that time.

did you know that 29,800,000 trees get cut down in one day? or 2,000,000 animals get killed a day? If you still don't believe me, look around you!
